# Samba Sample App

I make a sample app to use good practices in a Flutter project, trying to make a
clean code and a good architecture.

The project uses Riverpod as a state managment. making a good sample to take
code for future projects.

Using an [API](https://github.com/hectorAguero/samba-public-api) created by me
with the data of multiples sites about the Samba Schools in Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
